# remake

Building my own build system so I can't complain about things I don't like.

### But why?

I like to build and tinker with stuff, its good to learn, and also the above.. 
If I don't like it, I could just change it or I'll argue myself down \o/

### Where is this at?
As of the commit that updates this readme.. 

- Incremental Compiliaton
- Embeded Lua build file
- Works for C projects small and mid sized as far as I've tried.


### Whats next?

Check the TODOS, I usually throw my current ideas there of what I'd like to try and work on next.

### Can I help?

This is a hobby project that I'm not really looking for outside help on, but hey, feel free to make a PR, but fair warning I might use it more as inspiration to rewrite or add things myself then merge.

## Changes:

- Added `library_dirs` to `build.lua` which functions like `-L` in the compiler
- Updated header files to now use `pix.h` merged large file
- New scripts for quick build and re-run for testing.
