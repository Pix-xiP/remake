## What needs to be worked on?

Threads to compile multiple .o files at once?
Use threads or multiple forks to compile in parallel?

Writing to a build folder?

Installing binary to a known location?

Default optimisations?

Build for multiple platforms / architectures?

Leave O files on error or cleanup? - Keep track of files changed?

- Write better helper scripts
- Potentially move to using Taskfile to manage quick commands instead of scripts
- Write better bootstrap setup
- Ship version of remake that can build remake instead of bootstrap script?
